This is the compilation of my work from CS235 Data Structures taken in the Fall of 2020 from Brigham Young University.

All work is my own and was created under the direction of my professor. The folder contains class exercises,
but the major work is contained in the main labs, listed below. Many run inputs and print outputs to files
that were then checked with a DiffChecker. Turnin.txt files show the combined outputs.

The main labs are included in the following folders:

*Lab1 TODOList - Manipulates text to a file in the form of a "To do List" using command line arguments

*Lab2 Expression Manager - Postfix Infix Expressions Manager using Stacks

*Lab3 Speech - Predictive Text AI using Sets and Maps from input files

*Lab4 Pathfinder - Maze solver using Recursion

*Lab5-Quicksort - Implementation of Quicksort

*Lab7-BST - Binary Search Tree of numbers

*Lab8-AVL - Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree of numbers
